# SketchSFUIFonts - a backup of Sketch's San Francisco fonts ("SFUIDisplay", "SFUIText")

Once upon a time, Sketch used to come with a bunch of default San Francisco fonts (namely `SF UI Display` and `SF UI Text`), because you had to be a paying developer to download them from Apple. 


This is no longer the case - you can now download the official San Francisco font files from Apple: `SF Compact Display`, `SF Compact Text`, `SF Pro Display`, and `SF Pro Text`.
As a result, Sketch's iOS UI Design library now just tells you to download the official font files from Apple, which makes sense!


That's not great for compatibility, though.
Most iOS Sketch files I open are using Sketch's version of the San Francisco fonts (`SF UI`), and even when I replace them with the new versions, textboxes can become too narrow, and everything just feels a little off.


So, I've created this archive of the font files to make your life a bit easier.
Now you can have `SF UI Display`, `SF UI Text`, `SF Compact Display`, `SF Compact Text`, `SF Pro Display`, and `SF Pro Text` all running alongside each other, meaning ultimate compatibility ðŸ™Œ


This archive contains all of the `SF UI` fonts, and you can download the `SF Pro` + `SF Compact` fonts directly from Apple's site here: https://developer.apple.com/design/downloads/SF-Font.dmg
Goes without saying, I didn't create any of this. All of this is Apple's IP, all rights go to them, etc. I just put it in one place.

Enjoy! âš¡
