# SF UI Text and SF UI Display archive üîÄ

Once upon a time, Sketch used to come with a bunch of default San Francisco fonts, because you had to be a paying developer to download them from Apple.


This is no longer the case - you can now download the official San Francisco font families (SF Compact and SF Pro) from Apple.
As a result, Sketch's iOS UI Design library now tells you to download the official font files from Apple, which makes sense üëç


However, these fonts are different, and there's not really a nice backup of them anywhere. That's not great for compatibility.


Most iOS Sketch files I open are using Sketch's version of the San Francisco fonts. Even when I replace them with the official fonts, the textboxes can become too narrow, and everything just feels a little off.


So, I've created this archive of the font files to make your life a bit easier.
Now you can have `SF UI Display`, `SF UI Text`, `SF Compact Display`, `SF Compact Text`, `SF Pro Display`, and `SF Pro Text` all running alongside each other, meaning ultimate compatibility üôå


This archive contains all of the `SF UI` fonts. You can download the `SF Pro` + `SF Compact` fonts directly from Apple's site here: https://developer.apple.com/design/downloads/SF-Font.dmg
Goes without saying, I didn't create any of this. All of this is Apple's IP, all rights go to them, etc. I just put it in one place.

Enjoy! ‚ö°
